# Network Measurement and Data Analysis Lab

This repository contains three lab assignments from the *Network Measurement and Data Analysis Lab* course at Politecnico di Milano.  
The assignments focus on applying data analysis and machine learning techniques to real-world networking problems, including application traffic classification, optical network quality estimation, and traffic prediction.

## Contents

### 1. Application Flow Identification
- **Objective:** Identify traffic flows of different applications (e.g., YouTube, OneDrive) using machine learning classifiers such as Logistic Regression and XGBoost.
- **Key Steps:**  
  - Dataset creation and preprocessing  
  - Feature distribution visualization  
  - Hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation  
  - Model training and performance evaluation  
  - Multi-class application identification  
- **Skills Applied:** Python, scikit-learn, data preprocessing, ML model evaluation, PCA visualization.

### 2. Quality of Transmission (QoT) Estimation in Optical Networks
- **Objective:** Predict the QoT (SNR) for lightpaths in optical networks to optimize modulation format selection and reduce resource waste.
- **Key Steps:**  
  - Raw data exploration and feature extraction  
  - Visualization of correlations between features and SNR  
  - Training Neural Networks and Linear Regression models  
  - Evaluating impact of using single vs multiple features  
  - Analysis of inaccurate predictions and safety margins  
  - Studying effects of uncertain fiber span lengths  
- **Skills Applied:** Python, regression models, neural networks, performance metrics (MSE, R²), feature impact analysis.

### 3. Traffic Prediction
- **Objective:** Predict mobile network traffic using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
- **Key Steps:**  
  - Preprocessing of Telecom Italia Milano GRID dataset (CDRs)  
  - Feature extraction and dataset preparation for ANN and LSTM  
  - Model training, evaluation, and comparison (ANN vs LSTM)  
  - Assessment of over/under-provisioning costs for resource allocation  
- **Skills Applied:** Python, Keras/TensorFlow, time series prediction, ANN, LSTM, performance metrics (MSE, MAE, R²).
